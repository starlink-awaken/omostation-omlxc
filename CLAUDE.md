# Session guide

Read `AGENTS.md`, inspect `git status --short`, then read the relevant tests and
implementation before editing. Treat `tests/test_omlxc.py` as immutable legacy
characterization coverage unless the assigned task explicitly changes legacy
behavior. New v3 code belongs in `src/omlxc`; hardware tests must be explicitly
marked and must not run by default.
